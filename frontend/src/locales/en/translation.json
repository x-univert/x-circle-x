      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How to join an existing circle?",
        "answer": "To join a circle, navigate to the Circles page, select an open circle for recruitment, and click 'Request to join'. Existing members will vote to approve your application."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How much does it cost to create a circle?",
        "answer": "Creating a circle is free. Only blockchain transaction fees (gas) are charged, usually a few cents in EGLD."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What happens if a member doesn't contribute?",
        "answer": "The smart contract ensures that distribution can only happen if all members have contributed. Delinquent members can be reported by the community."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "How are funds distributed?",
        "answer": "Funds are distributed according to the order of member registration in the circle. Each member receives the full pot once during the circle's lifetime."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "What are the fees?",
        "answer": "X-CIRCLE-X charges 3% fees on each distribution. These fees are used to maintain the platform and fund its development."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Are my funds secure?",
        "answer": "Yes, your funds are secured by the smart contract on the MultiversX blockchain. No one, not even the X-CIRCLE-X team, can access your funds without your authorization."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "Can I leave a circle in progress?",
        "answer": "Once you have joined a circle and it has started, you cannot leave before the end. This ensures system integrity for all members."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "How does voting work?",
        "answer": "When a new member requests to join, all current members can vote. A majority of positive votes is required to accept the new member."
