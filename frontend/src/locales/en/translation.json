    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": {
        "question": "What is blockchain voting?",
        "answer": "Blockchain voting uses distributed ledger technology to record votes in a transparent, secure, and immutable way. Each vote is a transaction on the blockchain, making it impossible to alter or delete after it's been cast."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Is my vote anonymous?",
        "answer": "Yes! DEMOCRATIX uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure your vote is completely anonymous. While your transaction is recorded on the blockchain, your actual vote choice is encrypted and cannot be linked to your wallet address."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Do I need cryptocurrency to vote?",
        "answer": "Yes, you need a small amount of EGLD (MultiversX's native token) to pay for transaction fees (gas). The cost is minimal - typically less than $0.01 per vote."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What is IPFS and why do you use it?",
        "answer": "IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized storage network. We use it to store election descriptions, candidate information, and images in a distributed way, ensuring data availability and censorship resistance."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Can I change my vote after submitting?",
        "answer": "No. Once a vote is recorded on the blockchain, it's immutable and cannot be changed. This ensures the integrity of the election results. Make sure you've selected the correct candidate before confirming."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "How do I create an election?",
        "answer": "Connect your wallet, navigate to the 'Create Election' page, fill in the election details (title, description, dates), add candidates with their information, and submit the transaction. Your election will be live on the blockchain!"
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "What happens after an election closes?",
        "answer": "When an election ends, it moves to 'Closed' status. The election creator must then finalize the results, which calculates and permanently records the final vote counts on the blockchain."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "Is DEMOCRATIX open source?",
        "answer": "Yes! DEMOCRATIX smart contracts and frontend code are open source. You can audit the code, verify the logic, and even contribute to the project on our GitHub repository."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "Which networks does DEMOCRATIX support?",
        "answer": "Currently, DEMOCRATIX is deployed on MultiversX Devnet (for testing), Testnet (for pre-production), and will soon be available on Mainnet for production use."
      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "How can I trust the results?",
        "answer": "All votes are recorded on the MultiversX blockchain, which is public and transparent. Anyone can verify the vote counts using blockchain explorers. The smart contract logic is open source and auditable."
